## Introduction

**Umo Editor** is an open-source document editor based on **Vue 3** and **Tiptap**. It provides powerful document editing capabilities and AI-assisted creation features. Umo Editor supports pagination and standard web layouts, Markdown syntax, rich text editing, insertion of multiple node types, page style customization, document export, and printing.

It also supports custom extensions, multi-language settings, and dark mode. Additionally, we provide a standalone text preview component, **[Umo Viewer](https://github.com/umodoc/viewer)**, which can be integrated into your projects to preview documents.

The key advantage of Umo Editor is that it is **completely open-source and self-controllable**, supporting **private deployment**. You can safely use it in an intranet environment without worrying about data security. Built with Vue 3 and Tiptap, Umo Editor benefits from their extensive ecosystems and active communities, allowing for quick problem-solving and flexibility.

As an independent Vue 3 plugin, Umo Editor can be easily integrated into any Vue 3 project with zero configuration. For non-Vue 3 projects, you can embed it via an **iframe**.
